# AI Prompt Log

This file records AI-assisted work transparently. Passwords, tokens, connection strings, and other
secrets must be removed before prompts are added.

## 2026-07-28 — Planning

**Prompt summary:** Plan a full-stack CRUD vehicle inventory assignment emphasizing TDD,
authentication and security, atomic stock updates, clean architecture, Git history, documentation,
and transparent AI usage.

**Decisions:**

- TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, JWT, bcrypt
- React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- Vitest, Supertest, and React Testing Library
- Environment-seeded administrator; public registration cannot choose an admin role
- Atomic conditional database updates for purchasing

## 2026-07-28 — Milestone 1

**Prompt summary:** Start Milestone 1 and evaluate using Supabase as the database.

**Decision:** Use Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL with Prisma. Keep authentication in Express rather than
Supabase Auth so the assignment's JWT, password-hashing, and role-authorization requirements remain
visible and testable. Keep a local PostgreSQL 17 Docker service for offline development and CI-style
verification.
